**Data Analysis Projects**


Welcome to my collection of data analysis projects! Here, you'll find a series of projects that showcase my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. Each project includes a detailed exploration of the data, the methodology used, and the insights gained. The projects are created using Python, SQL, and Excel, among other tools. Whether you're interested in business analytics, data cleaning, or machine learning, there's something here for everyone. Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
